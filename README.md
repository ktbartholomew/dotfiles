# dotfiles

These are some rudimentary and simple dotfiles and other settings files that I like. Portions borrowed from [https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

## Installation

```console
$ ./bash/install.sh
$ echo "source ~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```
